This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) is called without proper error handling.  The application crashes silently if `someAsyncOperation` throws an error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, implementing proper error handling using `try...catch` to gracefully handle potential issues.
